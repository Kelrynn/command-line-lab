Kint is supposedly a con man, and has scammed numerous people out of healthy sums of money. One of these scams, according to a shady lawyer named "Kobayashi," whom ended in the loss of 50,000+ dollars that belonged to the legendary underworld kingpin, Keyser Soze. It was because of this debt to Soze that Kint was supposedly recruited along with a small crew of other criminals into an elaborate plot to help Soze. The plot involved them hijacking a boat and destroying the cocaine onboard. Once aboard, the criminals found that there was no cocaine, and that there was another game afoot. All of the criminals were killed, except for Kint, who stayed behind, and a Hungarian mob member, who was horribly injured when the boat was set ablaze by Keyser Soze himself.

Kint is shown to be crippled, suffering from cerebral palsy. He has one lame foot and cannot move his left hand.
